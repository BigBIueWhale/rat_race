# Unique Solution
* Breadth First Search (BFS as opposed to DFS or DP) 
* Simulation with eliminations
# Just Like Real Stock Traders
# O(k^3)
My solution simulates traders ("Traveler"s) buying and selling stocks.
\
Each day each trader has two options: trade or not trade.
\
That binary decision causes the number of simulated traders to double each passing day.
\
An elimination technique is used to reduce the number of traders each day to a maximum of k+1
\
The elimination technique is a O(n^2) algorithm where n is the number of traders.
