# 🚀Unique Solution🚀
* Breadth First Search (BFS as opposed to DFS or DP) 
* Simulation with eliminations
# Just Like Real Stock Traders (🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀)
# O(k^3)
🦀 My solution simulates 💻 traders ("Traveler"s) buying and selling stocks 📈.
\
🦀 Each day each trader has two options: trade or not trade (🤑).
\
🦀 That binary decision causes the number of simulated traders to double each passing day.
\
🦀 An elimination technique is used to reduce the number of traders each day to a maximum of k+1 📉
\
🦀 The elimination technique is a O(n^2) algorithm where n is the number of traders.
